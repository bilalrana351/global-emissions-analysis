# Global CO2 Analysis Project

This project analyzes global CO2 emissions data through data cleaning, enrichment, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.14 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Alternative: Using uv (if you have uv installed)**

```bash
# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync
```

## Running the Project

**Important:** Follow these steps in order to ensure proper data processing:

### Step 1: Data Cleaning
Run the data cleaning notebook first to prepare the raw data:

```bash
jupyter notebook data_cleaning.ipynb
```

Execute all cells in the notebook to generate the cleaned dataset.

### Step 2: Data Enrichment
Run the data enrichment notebook to add additional features:

```bash
jupyter notebook data_enrichement.ipynb
```

Execute all cells in the notebook to enrich the cleaned data.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform exploratory analysis to understand patterns and insights:

```bash
jupyter notebook eda.ipynb
```

Execute all cells in the notebook for comprehensive data exploration.

### Step 4: Explanatory Analysis
Run the explanatory analysis notebook for deeper insights:

```bash
jupyter notebook explanatory_analysis.ipynb
```

Execute all cells in the notebook for detailed explanations of findings.

### Step 5: Interactive Dashboard (Optional)
To view the live interactive dashboard with visualizations:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will open in your default web browser (typically at `http://localhost:8501`).

## Notes

- Make sure to activate your virtual environment before running any commands
- Each notebook should be run sequentially as later notebooks depend on data generated by earlier ones
- The Streamlit dashboard can be run independently if the processed data files already exist
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the Streamlit server

## Deactivating Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project:

```bash
deactivate
```
